  "body": "# Server Monitor\r\n([servermonitor.online](https://servermonitor.online))\r\n\r\nServer Monitor is a secure remote monitoring system for Windows-based servers and workstations. At this moment the project is at early development stage. Server Monitor is easy to install and configure. It is also secure: no back-doors and no remote access.\r\n\r\nMonitoring features:\r\n- statistics of memory and CPU usage for several hours;\r\n- tracking the status of selected services;\r\n- statistics for errors in Windows Log;\r\n- disk space monitoring;\r\n- tracking the most memory/CPU consuming processes.\r\n\r\nThe project includes at client side:\r\n- [Server Monitor Agent](SrvMon-Agent) - windows monitoring service;\r\n- [Configuration utility](SrvMon-Agent-Configurator).\r\n\r\nThe server side:\r\n- [WCF-based web-service](SrvMon-WebService) receiving data from Server Monitor Agent;\r\n- [ASP.NET MVC-based web-application](SrvMon-WebApp) as remote monitoring interface ([the website](https://servermonitor.online) is in Russian only at the moment).\r\n\r\nAlso the project includes:\r\n- [common libraries](SrvMon-Common);\r\n- MySQL database.\r\n\r\nAn acceptable level of safety implemented:\r\n- data transfer from Server Monitor Agent to WCF service using SSL transport security with client credentials;\r\n- exclusive use of HTTPS protocol in web-application\r\n- ASP.NET Identity system reduces the risk of leakage of credentials to a minimum (based on [MySql.AspNet.Identity](https://github.com/radenkozec/MySqlIdentity))\r\n- two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator or e-mail code;\r\n- confirmation of new accounts via e-mail (based on [SendGrid](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp));\r\n- authentication using third-party identity providers (only Google at the moment);\r\n- account lock-out when brute-force password hacking.\r\n\r\nFurther development:\r\n- extension of monitoring features range;\r\n- implementation of user notification features;\r\n- web-application internationalization (only Russian at the moment; configuration utility is globalized);\r\n- web-application design development (basic at the moment).\r\n\r\nClient software system requirements:\r\n- Windows Sever 2008 (Windows 7) or later;\r\n- .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.\r\n\r\n[Download Server Monitor Agent](https://github.com/laberko/ServerMonitor/releases/latest).\r\n",
